## 3 Fun Facts About Sopron That Will Blow Your Mind  
1. **Once a Roman Frontier Town**: Sopron has ancient roots, dating back to Roman times when it was known as "Sopianae." It even served as the border town for the Roman Empire, guarding the gates against invaders.  
2. **The Birthplace of the "Alkali Karl"**: Sopron is famous for its drying lakes that naturally produce "alkali," a unique sodium carbonate used for centuries. Locals jokingly call themselves "alkali karls" (though we suspect it’s not a title they’re really proud of).  
3. **A Tiny Piece of Austria**: Sopron is so close to the Austrian border that the local dialect, *Wachau German*, is basically Austrian. But don’t worry—everyone still speaks Hungarian with a smattering of humor.
