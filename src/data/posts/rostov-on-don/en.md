SUMMARY: Rostov-on-Don is Russia’s sun-soaked, laid-back cousin—where the Don River flows lazily, locals crack jokes over steaming bowls of kulesh, and the only thing stricter than the weather is the city’s commitment to hospitality. Forget clichés: this vibrant hub proves Southern Russia is all about warmth, whimsy, and unexpected charm.
