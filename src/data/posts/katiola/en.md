summary: "A 2-sentence summary. Keep it punchy. \"Katiola, Ivory Coast, is the unassuming gem where cotton fields meet warm smiles and unexpected adventures. Forget the usual tourist trail—this hidden city offers authentic culture, delicious eats, and a reality-check that’s way more fun than expected.\" For the CONTENT section in Markdown. Use ## for section headers. Make sure each section has the required elements with humor and info. Check for accuracy: Katiola is in the Hambol region, part of the Vallée du Bandama district. Cotton is indeed a major industry. The Fête du Coton is a real festival. Names: Yes, Katiola comes from \"Kati\" meaning \"cut\" in Baoulé, referring to the forest being cut to establish the city. Local food: Foutou, Attieké, and perhaps \"sakora\" or \"koutoukou\" but I think \"griot\" (fried pork) is popular too. For food section, I'll pick \"Foutou with peanut sauce\" and \"Attiéké with grilled fish\" as staples. In the itinerary: Morning at Marché Central, then visit the local cultural center (if it exists—maybe not, so say \"a traditional crafts workshop\"), then the Bandama River for a walk, and evening at a local restaurant. For expectation vs. reality: \"Expect: A bustling metropolis with neon signs and crowded streets. Reality: A peaceful town where the most exciting event is watching a goat outsmart the market vendor. It’s like a slow-motion dance party with cows.\" Local's Cheat Sheet: \"Transport: Taxi rouges are the way to go, but be ready for impromptu carpooling—your seatmate might just become your new best friend. Etiquette: If you don’t say 'Bonjour' first, you’ll be seen as a rude tourist—sorry, but that’s the law of the land. Hidden gem: The riverside spot where locals gather to fish and share stories; skip the guidebooks and just follow the smell of grilled fish.\" Encouraging conclusion: \"Katiola might not have the glitz of Abidjan or the grandeur of Yamoussoukro, but it’s got something better—the kind of genuine warmth that sticks with you long after you leave. So pack your curiosity, leave your expectations at the door, and dive into the real Ivory Coast. Trust me, your Instagram will thank you for the unique shots, and your soul will thank you for the real connection.\" Now, write the full post in Markdown. Use bold for emphasis where needed, like **Foutou** for food. Lists for fun facts and itinerary. Keep the tone light and conversational. Double-check the format:"
