## A Playful Welcome  
**Bienvenidos a Paraná**, the capital of Entre Ríos that swings harder than a hammock on the Paraná River and smiles wider than a *locro* pot on a winter night. Whether you’re here for the river views, the historic streets, or the legendary asado, prepare to be charmed, slightly sweaty, and forever hooked on *medialunas* (sweet croissants) that melt in your mouth faster than you can say “¡Che!”

## Fun Facts About Paraná  
- **Capital of the “Green Thumb” Province** – Entre Ríos literally means “between rivers,” and Paraná sits snugly between the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, making it the ultimate junction of water, greenery, and friendly locals.  
- **A French‑Inspired Grid** – The city’s layout was designed by French engineer *Pedro de Goye*, one of the few Argentine cities that still follows a planned, grid‑like pattern from the early 19th century.  
- **Longest Riverwalk in the Region** – The *Costanera* (riverfront promenade) stretches for more than 3 km, beating Montevideo’s famous Rambla in length—because nothing says “we love our river” like a never‑ending stroll.  
- **Museum in a Train Station** – The *Museo de la Ciudad* is housed in an old railway station, making it a perfect spot for history buffs who also enjoy a good “choo‑choo” selfie.

## Local Food You Must Try  
- **Asado** – The quintessential Argentine BBQ. In Paraná, you’ll find *asado de costilla* (ribs) and *asado de vacío* (flank steak) grilled to smoky perfection.  
- **River Fish** – Because the Paraná is literally at your doorstep, try *surubí* or *pacú*—fried, grilled, or in a savory stew called *pescado al plato*.  
- **Empanadas** – These flaky pastries come stuffed with meat, cheese, or *humita* (sweet corn). Grab a dozen from a local *casa de empanadas* and thank us later.  
- **Locro** – A thick, hearty stew of corn, beans, and pork, perfect for cooler evenings (or when you need a comforting hug in a bowl).  
- **Dulce de Leche Delights** – From *alfajores* to *crema paleta*, satisfy your sweet tooth with the nation’s beloved caramel.  
- **Tereré** – The chilled version of *mate*, sipped through a metal straw on hot days—ideal for cooling off while pretending you’re a local.

## The Local’s Cheat Sheet

- **Tipping** – 10 % is customary in restaurants; leave the change for great service.  
- **Hidden Gems**  
  - *El Hornillo* – A tiny bakery famous for its *facturas* (pastries) that vanish before noon.  
  - *Casa de la Empanada* – Hand‑made empanadas that’ll make you want to move in.  
  - *Jardín Botánico* – A quiet oasis with native flora, perfect for a leisurely afternoon stroll.
