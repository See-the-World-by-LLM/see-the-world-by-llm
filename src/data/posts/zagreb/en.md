## 1. A Playful Welcome
Welcome, intrepid wanderer, to Zagreb – the city that wears a crown of cobblestones, a suit of museums, and a mischievous grin that says “Come for the coffee, stay for the croissants (and the surprise street‑performers)!” If you’ve ever wanted to feel like you’ve stepped into a fairy‑tale mixed with a hipster’s Instagram feed, you’re in the right place. Pack your curiosity, a sturdy pair of shoes, and maybe a spare napkin – you’ll need it for the cheese‑laden delights ahead.

## 2. Fun Facts That Will Make You Go “Whoa!”
- **Zagreb’s “Z” is a secret superhero**: The city’s name starts with a ‘Z’, which in the local alphabet is pronounced “zuh”. Croatians love to brag that it’s the only capital whose name starts with the same letter as the word “zebra” – a fact that never fails to start conversations in bars.  
- **A tram‑driven love story**: The city’s tram network was inaugurated in 1910, and the first line still runs the exact route it did a century ago. Spotting a vintage tram is like seeing a time‑traveling local who refuses to miss brunch.  
- **Grič Tunnel – a hidden underground superhero**: Built during World War II as a secret passage for the resistance, it now serves as a quirky underground museum and an emergency shelter. Walk its dimly lit corridors and you’ll feel like you’re starring in a low‑budget James Bond flick.  

## 3. Local Food You Must Try
| Dish | Why It’s a Must‑Try | Where to Find It |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Štrukli** (baked or boiled cheese‑filled dough) | It’s basically the comfort food equivalent of a hug in pastry form. | *Dolac* market stalls or *Vinodol* restaurant. |
| **Peka** (meat or seafood baked under a bell‑shaped lid) | The slow‑cooked aroma will make you forget you ever ate pizza before. | *Didov San* in the Upper Town. |
| **Zagreb’s Coffee Culture** (especially a “kava duga”) | The city fuels its residents with strong, black coffee – perfect for powering through museum hopping. | Any café on Tkalčićeva Street; try *Mali Medo*. |
| **Croatian “Cevapi”** (grilled minced meat rolls) | Small, mighty, and best devoured with fresh onions and ajvar. | *Klapa* street food stand. |

## 4. One‑Day Itinerary (If You Only Have 24 Hours)

## 5. Expectation vs. Reality (Humorous Comparison)
| Expectation | Reality |
|-------------|----------|

| **“It’ll rain all day.”** | Weather in Zagreb is like a mischievous cat – it may sprinkle, but you’ll still get plenty of sunshine (and an excuse to wear that stylish raincoat). |

## 6. The Local’s Cheat Sheet
- **Transport Hacks**: Purchase a **ZET daily ticket** (€4) for unlimited bus, tram, and trolleybus rides. It’s cheaper than a coffee addiction and lasts all day.  
- **Etiquette Essentials**: When entering a café, **say “Dobar dan”** (good day) to the staff – it earns you a friendly nod and sometimes a free biscuit.  
- **Hidden Gem**: **Mirogoj Cemetery** – not just a resting place, but a stunning open‑air museum of art nouveau tombstones; perfect for a serene walk.  
- **Language Shortcut**: Learn **“Molim”** (please) and **“Hvala”** (thank you). The locals love when tourists sprinkle a little Croatian into conversation.  
- **Cash vs. Card**: Most places accept cards, but market stalls and small kiosks prefer **cash** (bring some kuna).  
- **Free Wi‑Fi**: Spot the blue “Free Wi‑Fi” signs in parks and tram stations – perfect for uploading your epic Instagram stories.
