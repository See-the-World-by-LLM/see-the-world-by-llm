 Let's plan:

 1. Playful Welcome: 
    - Welcome the reader with a fun, energetic tone. Maybe joke about the name or the journey.

 2. Fun Facts (at least 3):
    - Fact 1: Tulsipur was once a kingdom (Tulsipur State) and now is a sub-metropolitan city in Dang Deukhuri.
    - Fact 2: It's known for its religious harmony (Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Christian) and many temples/mosques.
    - Fact 3: The city is a gateway to the beautiful Deukhuri Valley and is surrounded by the Mahabharat Range.

 3. Local Food You Must Try:
    - Mention local specialties: 
        - **Gundruk ko Jhol** (fermented leafy green vegetable soup)
        - **Sidra** (a type of local bread, often made from rice or wheat, sometimes stuffed)
        - **Local Thakali Thali** (since Thakali cuisine is popular in the region, but note that Tulsipur has its own Thakali restaurants)

 4. One-Day Itinerary:
    - Morning: Visit the Tulsipur Bazaar and local temples (like the Shiva Temple).
    - Afternoon: Head to the nearby Rapti River for a picnic or short walk, then lunch at a local eatery.
    - Evening: Explore the local market for handicrafts and try street food. End with sunset views from a nearby hill.

 5. Expectation vs. Reality (humorous):
    - Expectation: A sleepy village with nothing to do.
    - Reality: A bustling town with chaotic charm, where you might get caught in a parade of goats or find a festival happening.

 6. The Local’s Cheat Sheet:
    - Transport: Tempos and rickshaws are common. Bargain for rickshaws. Buses are available but crowded.
    - Etiquette: Dress modestly, remove shoes before entering homes/temples, and use your right hand for giving/taking.
    - Hidden Gems: Ask locals about the nearby hot springs (Tapti Kunda) or the less-visited Siddha Baba Temple.

 7. Encouraging Conclusion:
    - Encourage the reader to visit and experience the warmth of the people and the unexpected adventures.
