## A playful welcome
Welcome, wanderlusters, to Tournai – the city that proudly claims it’s older than your grandma’s favorite recipe, yet still manages to surprise you with a **Michelin‑starred chocolate shop** and a cathedral that looks like it was designed by a very enthusiastic Lego enthusiast. Pack your curiosity (and maybe a raincoat, because Belgium loves a good drizzle) and let’s dive into the charms of this hidden gem!

## Fun facts
- **Ancient bragging rights:** Tournai is often touted as **the oldest city in Belgium**, with human settlement dating back to the Neolithic era – that’s older than most of our great‑grandparents’ jokes!  
- **Cathedral of cat‑calls:** The **Cathedral of Notre-Dame** isn’t just a pretty face; it houses a **12th‑century fresco of a dragon** that looks suspiciously like a medieval version of *Game of Thrones*.  
- **Bilingual brag:** While French dominates the streets, you’ll also hear **Dutch whispers** because Tournai sits just a hop, skip, and a French‑Flemish border away.  
- **Chocolate diplomacy:** The city’s **Chocolate Museum** once hosted a “cocoa summit” where diplomats settled a minor trade dispute by *eating* a 1‑ton chocolate bar. (No one was harmed, just sugar‑high.)

## Local food you must try
1. **Tournai‑style “pâté à la broyeuse”** – a hearty meat pâté lovingly served with a dollop of local mustard.  
2. **Moules-frites à la bruxelloise** – mussels cooked in white wine, garlic, and a secret herb blend, accompanied by the crispiest fries you’ll ever meet.  
3. **Belgian waffles (Gaufres à la Tournai)** – think **thick, caramelized edges** and a generous splash of fresh strawberries, because why not?  
4. **Speculoos ice cream** – a creamy homage to the famous spiced cookies, perfect for cooling down after a day of strolling.

## Expectation vs. Reality
| Expectation | Reality |
|-------------|----------|
| “I’ll only need a map because the city is tiny.” | You’ll need **two** maps: one for the cobblestone labyrinth and another for the **hidden cafés** that only locals know. |
| “Belgian weather is always rainy.” | Occasionally sunny! Just be ready to **switch from umbrella to sunglasses** in the same hour. |
| “I’ll just eat fries all day.” | You’ll fall in love with **artisan chocolates** and **gourmet waffles** – the fries become the sidekick. |
| “The cathedral will be quiet.” | Expect **crowds of selfie‑taking tourists**, plus a choir that rehearses at the most inconveniently harmonious hour. |

## The Local’s Cheat Sheet
- **Transport:** The city center is best explored on foot. For farther spots, grab a **TEC bus (line 5)** – tickets cost €1.80 and can be bought via the **TEC app**.  
- **Etiquette:** Always greet shopkeepers with a friendly **“Bonjour”** or **“Goedendag.”** A polite “s’il vous plaît” goes a long way, even if you’re ordering a **triple‑chocolate waffle**.  
- **Hidden gem:** Venture to **Parc de la Fosse aux Lions**, a serene park with an old lion’s den sculpture – perfect for a quiet picnic.  
- **Tip:** Carry **small change** (coins) for the bike‑share stations (**Velo’T**) and for the occasional **street performer tip jar**.  
- **Language hack:** Switch between French and Dutch phrases to impress locals – “Merci beaucoup” followed by “Dank u wel” earns extra smiles.
