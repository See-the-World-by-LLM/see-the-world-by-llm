## A Playful Welcome  
Welcome, wanderers, to Kansas City—where the skyline may be modest, but the **flavors, fandom, and fun are larger than life**. Grab your walking shoes, your appetite, and a GPS that’s ready for a few surprise detours; Kansas City loves to keep you on your toes (and possibly covered in tangy sauce).

## Fun Facts You Didn’t Know (But Will Definitely Use at Parties)  
- **Jazz Capital of the Midwest:** KC birthed the legendary “Kansas City Shift” in swing jazz; the city’s 18th & Vine district still hums with brass brilliance.  
- **A City of Fountains:** With more than **200 fountains**, KC earns the nickname “City of Fountains”—yes, we have more water features than Venice!  
- **Barbecue Hall of Fame:** The **American Royal World Series of Barbecue** dates back to 1891, making it the oldest continuous BBQ competition in the U.S.  
- **A Pancake Rivalry:** The local “Pancake Day” isn’t a holiday; it’s a rivalry between **Harper’s Pizza** and **Joe’s Kansas City** over who serves the fluffiest, most butter‑soaked stack. (Spoiler: both win.)  

## Local Food You Must Try (or Die Trying)  
| Dish | Where to Find It | Why It’s Worth the Mess |
|------|------------------|------------------------|

| **BBQ Ribs with “Sauce on the Side”** | **Q39** | Tender ribs slathered in a tangy, bourbon‑infused glaze; ask for extra sauce for the true experience. |
| **Kansas City-style Pizza** | **Garbage Pizza** | A buttery, deep‑dish crust smothered in sauce, cheese, and a dash of love (and sometimes actual garbage… just kidding!). |
| **Pecan Praline** | **The Classic Cup Café** | A sweet, buttery candy that’s the state’s unofficial dessert—great with coffee. |

## Expectation vs. Reality (Humorous Comparison)  
| Expectation | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| *“I’ll be strolling through a giant, neon‑lit downtown.”* | You’ll be **wandering a charming mid‑century modern city** with street art more “cool,” less “Hollywood.” |
| *“I’ll need a fancy valet for the parking.”* | **Free street parking** is abundant—just watch out for the occasional “**no parking on Sundays**” sign. |
| *“I’ll only eat salads because I’m health‑conscious.”* | **BBQ sauce will find you**—even the salad comes with a side of smoky brisket croutons. |
| *“I’ll get lost in traffic on I‑70.”* | **Traffic is mild**; the real puzzle is deciding which **fountain** to selfie‑with first. |
| *“I’ll need a five‑star hotel with a fancy lobby.”* | **Boutique inns** like **The Fontaine** deliver boutique chic without the snooty pretensions. |

## The Local’s Cheat Sheet
