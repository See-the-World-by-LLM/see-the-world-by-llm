summary: "Kairouan is the spiritual heart of Tunisia disguised as a laid-back carpet-making, pastry-frying theme park. Read this before you go so you don’t accidentally insult a baker, miss the world’s oldest minaret, or—worse—skip the sugar-drenched makroudh."

## 🕌 *Ahla w sahla!* – or, How to Pronounce “Kairouan” Without Spraining Your Tongue  
Welcome, time-pressed adventurers, rug-hunters, and carb enthusiasts! Kairouan (think “Ky-roo-ahn” while gargling a polite “k”) is Tunisia’s holiest city, but don’t let that scare you—its 1,300-year-old medina parties harder than your cousin’s DJ set in Berlin, only with more dates and less techno.

## 🧠 Fun Facts to Drop at Dinner (and Instantly Sound Smarter Than the Guidebook)  
1. **Four visits to Kairouan equal one hajj to Mecca**—spiritual bonus miles, no blackout dates.  
2. The Great Mosque’s minaret is basically the **Eiffel Tower of North Africa**: built in 836 CE, still the tallest kid on the block.  
3. The city’s **1,000+ underground cisterns** kept invaders thirsty and residents hydrated—history’s first “bring your own straw” policy.

## 🍯 Eat This or We Can’t Be Friends  
- **Makroudh**: Deep-fried semolina stuffed with dates, then drowned in honey. Cardiologists hate it; grandmothers swear by it.  
- **Mtabga**: Imagine a quesadilla that went to Tunisia, learned Arabic, and came back stuffed with spicy lamb and egg.  
- **Kairouani kamounia**: Beef, cumin, and enough garlic to ward off both vampires and small-talking taxi drivers.  
- **Mint tea “à la Kairouanaise”**: served in a glass so hot you could sterilize surgical instruments—blow first, Instagram later.

## ⏰ One-Day Dash: 24 Hours, Zero Regrets  
**08:00** – Breakfast of *brik* (runny-egg surprise) at Café Sidi Bouafif; dodge the cats plotting a coup.  
**09:00** – Great Mosque of Okba; selfies allowed in the courtyard, not inside—Allah has no filter.  
**10:30** – Medina alleyways: haggle for a rug, pretend you’re an extra in *Aladdin*, realize you still can’t fold a carpet properly.  
**12:30** – Lunch of *mtabga* at Restaurant La Kasbah; practice your “mmm” face for the chef.  
**14:00** – Bi’r Barouta camel-powered well: watch a camel walk in circles so you can drink history. Tip the camel; he works harder than you do.  
**15:30** – Mausoleum of Sidi Sahbi (Barber’s Mosque): admire the tiles, whisper a wish, wonder why your barber at home doesn’t have a tomb this nice.  
**17:00** – Coffee on rooftop *Café El Bey*; count minarets, pretend you’re playing Tunisian bingo.  
**19:00** – Sunset stroll atop the Aghlabid Pools—Instagram gold, plus free leg workout climbing the embankment.  
**20:30** – Dinner of *kamounia* followed by a *makroudh* food-coma; waddle happily back to your riad.

## 😂 Expectation vs. Reality  
**Expectation**: solemn, whisper-quiet holy city where you float ethereally between ancient walls.  
**Reality**: kids on scooters shouting “Bonjour, mon ami!”; grandmas beating rugs like they owe them money; bakeries pumping out honey fumes that fog your sunglasses. You’ll leave spiritually elevated… and 3 kg heavier.

## 🕵️‍♂️ The Local’s Cheat Sheet  
- **Taxi math**: City rides cost 5 dinars—if the meter’s “broken,” you’re the ATM.  
- **Friday etiquette**: many shops close for prayers; don’t panic, the pastry vendors stay open—Allah understands.  
- **Photo protocol**: Ask before snapping people; a smile and “Baraka Allahu fik” works better than zooming from a doorway like a spy.  
- **Hidden rug gem**: Cooperative Artisanale (near Bab Chouhada) fixed prices, no theatrical haggle, free mint tea that could raise the dead.  
- **Secret sunset**: climb the unmarked stairs of the medina wall by Dar Hassine Allani—locals will point if you look sufficiently lost.

## 🌟 Final Pep Talk  
Kairouan won’t just give you bragging rights and a suitcase full of spices; it’ll serve you history with a side of honey and a camel cameo. Show up hungry, leave humbled (and possibly haggard from rug negotiations). Either way, four visits are officially on the house—paradise points pending.
