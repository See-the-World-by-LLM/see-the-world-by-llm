## A playful welcome  
Welcome, intrepid wanderer, to Radviliskis—Lithuania’s best‑kept secret, the sort of place where the GPS says “you have arrived,” but the locals whisper, “you’re just on time for the coffee!” Grab your sense of humor (and maybe a sturdy pair of walking shoes) because we’re about to turn this modest town into your next brag-worthy travel story.

## Fun facts about the city  
- **Born in the Middle Ages, but still youthful:** Radviliskis was first mentioned in 1462, yet it’s famous for its “young spirit”—just ask the locals who still dance to 90s Lithuanian pop at the town square.  
- **A church with a twist:** The Church of St. Michael the Archangel has a bell tower that leans slightly, giving it the nickname “The Lithuanian Pisa.” Perfect for that Instagram “tilt” shot.  
- **Home to the world’s smallest museum of …**? Yes, the **Radviliskis Railway Museum** displays only three vintage locomotives, but each comes with a detailed story about the town’s love affair with the rails.  

## Local food you must try  
- **Cepelinai (Zeppelins):** These potato dumplings are stuffed with meat or cheese and are as hearty as a hug from a grandparent.  
- **Šakotis (Tree‑cake):** A spiky, layered cake that looks like a pine tree—great for impressing friends on Instagram.  
- **Kibinai:** Small pastries filled with mushrooms or meat, perfect for a quick snack while you wander the cobblestones.  
- **Radviliškio Blynai:** Thin, golden pancakes served with forest berry jam—yes, you’ll want seconds (or thirds).  

## One‑day itinerary (24 hours max)  
**Morning:**  
1. **Breakfast at Café „Kavos Kramas“** – order a *kava* (coffee) with a side of šakotis.  
2. **St. Michael’s Church** – climb the slightly leany tower for a panoramic view of the town’s red‑brick rooftops.  

**Midday:**  
3. **Radviliskis Market Square** – browse stalls for fresh produce, local honey, and handmade amber jewelry.  
4. **Lunch at „Džiaugsmas“** – try cepelinai drenched in sour cream and a side of pickled cucumber.  

**Afternoon:**  
5. **Radviliskis Railway Museum** – spend a relaxed hour among the three locomotives and learn why locals love “train gossip.”  
6. **Walk along the Šešuoliai River** – perfect for a postcard‑worthy selfie with the historic bridge.

7. **Dinner at „Gausus Garsas“** – indulge in kibinai and a glass of Lithuanian mead.  
8. **Sunset at the Town Hill** – watch the sky turn pink while locals gather for a spontaneous folk‑song jam.  

## Expectation vs. Reality (humorous comparison)  
| Expectation | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| **“I’m going to a sleepy hamlet with no Wi‑Fi.”** | **Free Wi‑Fi at the café, plus locals who will *actually* chat with you about the weather and the best beet soup.** |
| **“I’ll get lost in endless museums.”** | **Three locomotives, one church tower, and a market—plenty of sights, zero “Where’s the exit?” panic.** |
| **“I’ll be eating bland, boring food.”** | **Your taste buds will be dancing the *šokis* after the first bite of cepelinai.** |
| **“I’ll have to rent a car to get around.”** | **A friendly bike or a short walk does the trick; the town is compact enough to make your Fitbit jealous.** |

## The Local’s Cheat Sheet  
- **Transport:** The town is *walkable*; for longer trips, hop on the regional bus (look for the green “R” sign). Remember to buy a ticket before boarding—drivers are strict about that!  
- **Etiquette:** When greeting, a firm handshake and direct eye contact are appreciated. Avoid “yes” and “no” gestures that look like “thumbs up” (that’s reserved for celebrations).  
- **Hidden gems:**  
  - **The Whispering Wall** behind the church—lean close and you’ll hear faint echoes of folk tales.  
  - **Grandma’s Garden** (a little alley behind the market) where you can pick wild strawberries in late summer.  
  - **Night‑time bench at the river**—perfect for listening to the gentle clatter of the old rail tracks.  

## An encouraging conclusion  
So there you have it—Radviliskis may be small, but it’s a pocket‑sized adventure overflowing with charm, quirky history, and stomach‑satisfying delights. Pack your curiosity (and an appetite), and let this Lithuanian jewel prove that great things truly do come in modest packages. Happy travels!
