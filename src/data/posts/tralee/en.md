## A Playful Welcome
Welcome to Tralee, the town that’s basically a warm hug wrapped in lush green hills and a splash of midnight sun! If you’ve ever wanted to feel like a character in a Terry Pratchett novel—minus the trolls—you're in the right spot. Grab your raincoat, your sense of humor, and let’s set off on a jaunty Irish adventure.

## Fun Facts About Tralee
- **Home of the Rose of Tralee Festival**: Since 1959, this international music‑free beauty pageant has turned Tralee into a global stage for “the girl who embodies the spirit of the Irish diaspora.”  
- **County Kerry’s “Gateway”**: Tralee sits at the crossroads of the Ring of Kerry, making it the perfect launchpad for road‑trip photographers who love dramatic coastlines and sheep‑filled pastures.  
- **A Town with a Viking Past**: Archaeologists uncovered a Viking longhouse just outside the town centre—proof that even the ancient Celts needed a good Wi‑Fi hotspot.  
- **The “Marty” River Runs Through It**: The river’s name is literally “Marty” (short for “Marty’s River”), so you can brag about “Marty‑ing” your way through town.  

## Local Food You Must Try
- **Irish Stew** – A hearty blend of lamb, potatoes, carrots, and onions that’ll warm you faster than a fireplace in a drafty pub.  
- **Kerry Apple Pie** – Tart apples from the famous Cahersiveen orchards, encased in buttery pastry—served à la mode with a scoop of vanilla ice‑cream.  
- **Seafood Chowder** – Fresh Atlantic cod, mussels, and a splash of cream; perfect after a stroll along the River Lee.  
- **Bacon and Cabbage (or “Bacon & Kraut”)** – The classic Irish comfort food, best enjoyed with a pint of locally‑brewed stout.

- **Etiquette**: Always tip **10‑15 %** in restaurants and pubs—unless the server insists you “pay for the smile.”  
- **Hidden Gems**:  
  - **The Bunch of Lemons Pub** – A tiny, unmarked bar with world‑class ceilidh sessions.  
  - **Molly’s Market** – Saturdays only; pick up handmade Aran sweaters and freshly baked soda bread.
